description: A (somewhat up to date) list of commands for Red
---

Red is now modular and uses commands + subcommands~

If you are confused, type in `[p]help [command]` and if help command lists subcommands do `[p]help [command] [subcommand]`


`[p]` being short for your prefix, such as `!`, `.`, `^`<br><br><Br>

**NOTE:** Do not write your commands in `[]` or `[]`.

Wrong Example: [p]play [http://youtube.com.....]

Right Example:  [p]play http://youtube.com.....
