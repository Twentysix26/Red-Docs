A info.json will provide information about the repository or cog the end user is installing. What the info.json can provide are a set of messages. These messages will be displayed on actions the end user is taking.

### Repository info.json
A repository info.json sits at the root level of the repository (Before the cog folders). The following format is used for this info.json
```
{
    "AUTHOR" : "Author name",
    "NAME" : "Repository Name",
    "SHORT" : "A short description, appears on !cog list",
    "DESCRIPTION" : "A longer description, appears on !cog info repo"
}
```

### Cog info.json
A cog info.json sits in the cog folder (Besides the ``.py``). These are unique per cog. And can be changed per cog. The following format is used for them.
```
{
    "AUTHOR" : "Author name",
    "INSTALL_MSG" : "A install message that appears as soon as the end user does !cog install repo cogname",
    "NAME" : "The class name of the cog, MUST BE matching, including capitalization",
    "SHORT" : "A Short description, appears on !cog list repo",
    "DESCRIPTION" : "A longer description, appears on !cog list repo cogname"
}
```
